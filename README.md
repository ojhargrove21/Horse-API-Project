This is a volenteer project that is part of my goal to help better the comunities I live in.
The aim of this project is to help some of the horse clubs in Northern Maine to create and
maintain digital user data and entries, shifting them from fully paper. This also aims to
help give them more time for what they want to do and less time working on their books.

Please note that this is currently still a work in progress with a target prod date of summer 2026.
More demo code to be added after the prod date.
